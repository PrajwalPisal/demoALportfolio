## Summary

I am a results-driven and self-motivated Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience, Test Engineer, and Accomplished Mentor, crafting robust software solutions with a diverse technical skill set to deliver business useful insights. Currently excelling as a Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.hyvesolutions.com/">Hyve Solutions</a> in Fremont, CA, having a proven track record in the development and implementation of test processes, the development of automated software and server test scripts, and the analysis of failure reports to improve system reliability and product quality. Successfully trained and mentored 15+ junior employees across multiple company branches.

## Education

I earned my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from <a href="https://csumb.edu/">California State University, Monterey Bay</a> in **May 2023**, with a concentration in Software Engineering. I graduated with a **GPA of 3.7/4.0**, earning Academic Honors Distinction: **Cum Laude**, and was on the Dean's List for Fall 2021 and Spring 2023. I was part of the CSUMB Programming Team that ranked **71st at the ICPC Programming Contest 2022 PacNW-Div2 Region**.

**Relevant Coursework:** Python Programming, Software Engineering, Software Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, Microprocessor Architecture, Embedded Systems, Digital Electronics, Operating Systems, Web Programming, Internet Programming, Computer Networks, Database Management Systems.

## Research & Publications

My research interests span machine learning, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. I have authored research papers accepted, presented, and published in peer-reviewed international research conferences and journals with prestigious organizations including **Scientific Reports** (by Springer Nature) and **IEEE Access** (by IEEE). I have also served as a **Peer Reviewer** for international research conferences including ICML, NeurIPS, ACM SIGCSE, CE2CT, IBRL@RLC, AI4Math@ICML, ER@NeurIPS, and others. I have also judged 12+ high school research poster presentations at the NASA GL4HS 2025 Capstone Symposium.

## Professional Experience

In my current role at **Hyve Solutions** (Sept 2023 - Present), I proficiently administer and troubleshoot computer systems utilizing Linux, DMM, Bash, and Python, **reducing service outages by 80%** and **routine repairs by 25%**.
